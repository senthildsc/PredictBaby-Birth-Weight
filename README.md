# PredictBaby-Birth-Weight


## Background:

The Birthweight of the baby is something always curious for every
parent. Birthweight is often used as a proxy for fetal weight. Why
and what factors make the birth weight differ?

## Problem Statement:

Problems with this practice have recently been brought to light. We 
explore whether data available at birth can be used to predict 
estimated fetal weight using linear and quantile regression, random 
forests, Bayesian additive regression trees, and generalized boosted 
models.
The domain of childbirth and factors influencing childbirth and the
weight of a newborn is very vast. Through past studies, it has been 
observed that the factors which affect the childbirth range from 
biological characteristics like the baby's sex, race, age of mother 
and father, weight gained by the mother during pregnancy to 
behavioral characteristics like smoking and drinking habits of the 
mother, the education and living conditions of the parents.
